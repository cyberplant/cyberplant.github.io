Something

I don't wanna say I'm sorry
'Cos I know there is nothing wrong
Don't be afraid there is no need to worry
'Cos my feelings for you are still strong

Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cos I need you so

I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide for me
Is there a reason why
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me

I don't wanna say I'm sorry
'Cos I know there is nothing wrong
Don't be afraid there's no need to worry
'Cos my feelings for you are still strong

Hold me in your arms

Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cos I need you so

I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide for me
Is there a reason why
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me
