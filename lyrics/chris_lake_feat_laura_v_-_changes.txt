There are so many changes in my life 
I don't know if it's wrong or if it's right 
And I want you, want you by my side 
Everything is gonna be alright 

Changes in my life 
I won't leave you behind 
Changes in my life 
You will see in time 

Changes in my life 
You're always on my mind 
Changes in my life 
I got you by my side 

In life we're always looking 
Leave the past behind 
We try to see the warnings and read all the signs 
Sometimes you gotta take chances 
Nothing stays the same 
The world will keep on turning 
Again and again, again and again
