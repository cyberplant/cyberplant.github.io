(Shook it up) 

I never loved nobody fully 
Always one foot on the ground 
And by protecting my heart truly 
I got lost in the sounds 
I hear in my mind 
All of these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind all this music 

And it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart 
when it breaks my heart

Suppose I never, ever met you 
Suppose we never fell in love 
Suppose I never, ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft 
Suppose I never, ever saw you 
Suppose you never, ever called 
Suppose I kept on singing love songs just to break my own fall 
Just to break my fall 
Just to break my fall 
Just to break my fall
Break my fall 
Break my fall 

All my friends say that of course it's gonna get better 
Gonna get better 
Better better better better better better better



I never loved nobody fully 
Always one foot on the ground 
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost 
In the sounds 
I hear in my mind 
All these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind 
All of this music 
And it breaks my heart 
And It breaks my heart 

I hear in my mind 
All of these voices 
I hear in my mind all these words 
I hear in my mind 
All of this music 
And it breaks my heart 
And it breaks my heart 
and It Breaks my Heart 
when it Breaks my heart
but it breaks my heart 
when it breaks my heart
breaks my heart 
and it breaks my heart
and it breaks my heart
and it breaks my heart 
and it breaks my heart
