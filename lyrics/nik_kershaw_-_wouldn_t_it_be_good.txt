I got it bad 
you don't know how bad i got it 
you got it easy 
you don't know when you got it good 
it's getting harder 
just keeping life and soul together 
i'm sick of fighting 
even though i know i should 
the cold is biting 
through each and every nerve and fibre 
my broken spirit is frozen to the core 
don't wanna be here no more 

wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes 
even if it was for just one day 
and wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away 
wouldn't it be good to be on your side 
the grass is always greener over there 
wouldn't it be good if we cold live without a care 

you must be joking 
you don't know a thing about it 
you've got no problem 
I'd stay right there if it were you 
i got it harder 
you couldn't dream how hard it got it 
stay out of my shoes 
f you know what's good for you 
the heat is stifling 
burning me up from the inside 
the sweat is coming through each and every pore 
don't wanna be here no more 

wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes 
even if it was just for one day 
and wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away 
wouldn't it be good to be on your side 
the grass is always greener over there 
and wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care
