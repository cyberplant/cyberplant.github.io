====== Other Info ======

===== MaCy =====

 MaCy was a software for managing a CyberCafe. I've developed it with the idea
 of creating a full OpenSource CyberCafe application, but sadly I had to leave
 the development for time issues.

 I had it working in a few local CyberCafes for around 2 years with no problems.

===== MontevideoLibre =====

We're creating a local wireless community here. I don't have my node online yet
but soon I will. 

I've helped (not so much) with the development of a IRC bot called Uma, in TCL.
